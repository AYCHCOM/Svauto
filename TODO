* Make use of the ~/inventory or /etc/inventory subdirectories.

* Make presets based on yaml files that can be used directly inside of the
  "inventory subdir".

* New YAML Presets for:

  This imply that SVAuto will have new "Preset Scripts"! That are based on
  pre-defined YAML files.

  - 2 Servers 2 Switches scenario

  - MaaS in 3 VMs, Region, Rack and a Virtual Pod (reproduce problemas as well)

    Provide an awesome network topology, in a way that the deployed Machines
    can't reach the Region controller, so, we can make sure that all the traffic
    is passing through the Rack controller.

  - OpenStack from Ubuntu (following manual installation docs)

  - Ceph Ansible

  - OpenStack Ansible

  - OpenStack Ansible + Ceph


* LXD Support on ubuntu-virt role

* Way better support for Cloud Init

  Currently, SVAuto uses Cloud Init in many places!

  - Inside of ubuntu-virt role, when creating ISO images for KVM Guests

  - Inside of LXD role, when launching containers

  - Tried to use Cloud Init via MaaS but failed...

  - Packer build images with Cloud Init, which is failing on first boot of
    Ubuntu 18.04

  - Via Heat templates when launching stacks on OpenStack

  Soooo many places...

  The idea is to centralize all the Cloud Init knoledge and functions in a more
  central place and call it when needed.
